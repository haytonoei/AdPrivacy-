# AdPrivacy-
interesting tech that is privacy compliant and allow advertisers to still analyze useful data

problem: apple and government entities are contributing to an evolving privacy landscape. How can tech platforms evolve their advertising solutions to still serve advertisers? 

solutions:
1. Clean room (LiveRamp, Habu) aggregated insights. Use cases: Uber, Booking.com, Expedia 
2. Trusted execution environment (Intel SGX, AMD PSP), attestation required 
3. Secure multi party computation (mathematical, replaced by TE) never decrypt, homomorphic encryption

other things I'm following: 
1. aggregating
2. adding noise
3. 1:1 data 
4. transfer learning
5. cookieless tracking (first party cookies and server side client IDs)
6. Apple ATT
7. Apple SKAN
8. Google Privacy Sandbox
9. on-device optimization
